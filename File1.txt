Say a Developer has been assigned to enchance the code by adding "Feature A". The code is assigned to developer in aseparate branch "Feature A".This is done ,so that master branch contains only the code which is finished,finalized and ison production.Therefore no matter how many commits are made by developers on Feature A Branch ,it will not affect the Master Branch.

Once the code is finished,tested and ready ,we can merge the Feature A branch,with the Master branchand now the code is available on the production servers as well.
